This is my implementation of project 3: Pizza for CS50's Web Programming with Python and Javascript.

In this project, I had to build a web application for handling a pizza restaurant's online orders. Users are able to browse the restaurant's menu, add items to their cart and submit their orders. Meanwhile the restaurant owners are able to add and update menu items, and view orders that have been placed.

The web app contains:

1. A Registration/Login/Logout feature.
2. An index page that containts the menu of the restaurant and from there one can view and get details about a specific product.
3. A menu item page where one can specify the different toppings, the size and the number of items he wants to add in the cart.
4. A shopping cart page where one can view the items he has placed and make the final order. A delete button is to be added.
5. A viewing orders features where staff users or superusers can check and every order that has been made on the site, either pending or completed.

Running the app:
1. Run pip install -r requirements.txt.
2. Run python manage.py runserver
